     <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>ABOUT US 

                We, the team of Reliefope, are a real-time disaster relief and crisis management platform designed to bridge the gap between volunteers, NGOs, and government agencies and the people affected by disasters. Our mission is to ensure rapid, efficient, and well-coordinated aid distributions during emergencies.
                
                Using AI-driven analytics, real-time updates, and SMS alerts, we empower responders to take swift action in disaster-stricken areas. Our web extension allows instant reporting of crises, while our secure donation system (Razorpay)enables seamless fundraising for essential resources like food, medicine, etc.
                
                At Reliefope, we believe in harnessing technology for saving human lives in time of need, ensuring that no one is left behind. 
                
                Join us at Reliefope if you are interested to Volunteer and/or Donate to help the ones in need.
